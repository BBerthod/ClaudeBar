# ClaudeBar

A macOS menu bar app for monitoring your [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) usage in real time.

![macOS 14+](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-14%2B-blue) ![Swift 5.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.9-orange) ![No dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-none-brightgreen)

## Features

### Menu Bar
- **Brain icon** tinted by 5-hour usage (neutral → orange → red)
- **5h forecast indicator** (on by default) — shows the estimated time to the 5-hour limit and the reset countdown next to the icon, e.g. `~1h38 → ↻2h10` when you're on pace to hit the limit, or `↻2h10` when usage is calm. Toggle it in Settings › Display & Alerts.

### Dashboard
- **Estimated cost** for today, with a live fallback when `stats-cache.json` hasn't updated yet
- **7-day sparkline** — mini activity chart in the header showing the last week's message trend
- **Stats grid** — messages, sessions, tool calls, and tokens
- **Token distribution** by model (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) with a colour-coded bar
- **5h usage gauge** — circular gauge showing real-time 5-hour window utilization with color gradient (green → red) and pace indicator
- **Rate limit bars** — 7-day and Sonnet windows pulled directly from the Anthropic OAuth API
- **Burn rate card** — cost/hr, projected daily cost, and pacing zone (Chill / On Track / Hot / Critical) compared to your 30-day average
- **Human cost comparison** — estimated equivalent developer hours and cost, with ROI multiplier badge
- **Active sessions** with context-window usage estimate; click any session to jump to its terminal

### History
30-day activity charts for messages, sessions, tokens, and cost.

### Projects
Per-project usage and cost breakdown.

### Sessions
Active and recent session list. Tapping an active session focuses the terminal window running that Claude Code process.

### Settings
- Hook health monitor — checks that your `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks are correctly configured
- Notification preferences — daily digest (configurable hour) and cost threshold alerts
- **Usage threshold alerts** — automatic notifications at 80% and 95% of the 5-hour rate limit window, with per-reset-window deduplication

### Floating Overlay
A compact, always-on-top PiP panel listing active sessions. Toggle it with the pip button next to the tab bar. Draggable anywhere on screen, works across all Spaces.

### Desktop Widget
A floating always-on-top panel showing at a glance: 5-hour usage gauge, today's tokens, active session count, and estimated cost. Positioned at the bottom-right of the screen, works across all Spaces.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Xcode 15+ (for building from source)
- An active Claude Code installation at `~/.claude`

---

## Build & Run

ClaudeBar has **zero third-party dependencies** — only the Swift standard library, AppKit, and SwiftUI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BBerthod/ClaudeBar
cd ClaudeBar
swift build -c release
swift run
```

Or open in Xcode:

```bash
open Package.swift
```

## How It Works

ClaudeBar reads data from three sources, in priority order:

| Source | What it provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` | Primary stats — messages, sessions, tokens, model usage, 30-day history. File-watched for instant updates. |
| `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | Live fallback — parsed directly when `stats-cache.json` has no entry for today. Deduplicates by message ID. |
| Anthropic OAuth API | Real-time rate limit data (5h / 7d windows). OAuth token read from the system Keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`). Polled every 60 s. Auto-refreshes expired tokens via the OAuth refresh flow. |

Active sessions are detected by scanning `~/.claude/sessions/` and confirming each stored PID is still alive.

## Architecture

```
AppDelegate (pure AppKit)
├── NSStatusItem  ← menu bar icon
└── NSPopover     ← SwiftUI content (420 × 520 pt)
    └── ContentView (tab bar)
        ├── DashboardView
        ├── HistoryView
        ├── ProjectsView
        ├── SessionsView
        └── SettingsView

OverlayManager  ← floating NSPanels (sessions overlay + desktop widget)
```

All services use the `@Observable` macro (Swift 5.9 / iOS 17 / macOS 14 observation model) and run on `@MainActor`. There is no persistence layer — state lives in memory and is re-derived from files on every refresh cycle (30-second timer + file watching).

### Services

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|---------------|
| `StatsService` | Reads and watches `stats-cache.json` |
| `LiveStatsService` | Parses today's JSONL files when cache is stale |
| `SessionService` | Active and recent session detection + context estimation |
| `UsageService` | OAuth API rate-limit fetch, Keychain token management, auto-refresh |
| `BurnRateService` | Hourly cost rate, end-of-day projection, pacing zone |
| `ProjectService` | Per-project cost aggregation |
| `HookHealthService` | Validates Claude Code hook configuration |
| `NotificationService` | Cost threshold alerts, usage threshold alerts (80%/95%), daily digest |
| `OverlayManager` | Floating PiP panel + desktop widget panel lifecycle |

## Privacy

ClaudeBar never sends your usage data anywhere. All processing happens locally:

- Stats are read from `~/.claude` on your machine
- The only outbound network calls are to `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (rate-limit data) and `console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token` (token refresh), both using your existing OAuth credentials
